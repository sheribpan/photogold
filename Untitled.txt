Sheri Pan is a recent college graduate embarking on her new life as an adult by exploring her love of cities, traveling, food and design through photography.  Paying her bills as a legal assistant from 9 to 5, she uses photography as an outlet to unwind and set free her creative juices after a long day.  Through her images, she strives to spotlight the beauty in the everyday, from the hilly streets of San Francisco to the golden glows of a rich sunset.  In her free time, she enjoys volunteering, traveling, learning languages, jogging and dance.  She plans to pursue public interest, international, or technology law in the future. <a href="mailto:sheri(AT)sheribpan.com">Email</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sheribpan" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>
